# Fluentd v1.6.1 and v1.6.2 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.6.1 and v1.6.2. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
These release includes several enhancements and bug fixes.

### http\_server helper: Add title argument to the API

This fix is important to launch HTTP servers in different plugins.
Old implementation uses same thread identifier for all HTTP servers and it won't work.

Check also [API article](https://docs.fluentd.org/plugin-helper-overview/api-plugin-helper-http_server#create_http_server-title-addr-port-logger-default_app-nil-and-block).

### certificates: Support all private keys OpenSSL supports

fluentd assumes private key is RSA before.
Now, other types are supported, e.g. EC and DSA.

### Other bug fixes

* plugin_config_formatter: use new doc URL
* out_forward: Avoid zero division error when there are no available nodese

Enjoy logging!
