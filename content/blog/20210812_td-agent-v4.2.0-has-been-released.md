# TD Agent v4.2.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v4.2.0. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent-plugins-nursery/td-agent-builder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v420---20210729).

This release is a maintenance release of v4.x series.
We recommend to upgrade TD Agent because it contains latest Fluentd v1.13.3.


### Jemalloc was downgraded to v3.6.0

Because of excessive amounts of memory consuming issue, bundled version of jemalloc was downgraded from v5.2.1 to v3.6.0.

This issue seems a well known issue as follows:

* https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14718
* https://www.joyfulbikeshedding.com/blog/2019-03-14-what-causes-ruby-memory-bloat.html
* https://www.speedshop.co/2017/12/04/malloc-doubles-ruby-memory.html

Jemalloc v3.6.0 is stable enough (according to jemlloc's web site, it still seems be supported)

See https://github.com/fluent-plugins-nursery/td-agent-builder/issues/305 about details.

### Dependency to perl package was removed

In the previous versions, `td-agent` has dependency to perl packages.
This is because it bundles `jeprof`, but users do not want to install extra dependencies.
So, we decided to drop it.


Enjoy logging!
