Hi users!

ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/v1.19/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1191---20251106).

## Bug Fixes

### YAML configuration: Added Support for Array Notation

Previously, when specifying multiple values, you had to use a comma-separated list such as: `retryable_response_codes: 503, 504`.

With this update, you can now use more YAML-style array notations:

```yml
retryable_response_codes: [503, 504]
```

or

```yml
retryable_response_codes:
  - 503
  - 504
```

Note: The special element [`$arg`](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/config-file-yaml#special-yaml-elements) has supported array notation from earlier versions.

Note: There is still a known YAML syntax issue where specifying a single int value for an Array option causes a config error. For details, please refer to [#5149](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/5149).

Enjoy logging!
