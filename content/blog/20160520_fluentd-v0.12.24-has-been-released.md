## in\_tail: Add `path_key` and `encoding` parameters

We have [tail_path](https://github.com/sonots/fluent-plugin-tail_path) plugin to add tailing path to event record. This information is useful when you want to identify the origin in analytics phase. So we merged `tail_path` feature into core `in_tail`.

```
<source>
  @type tail
  path /path/to/app.log
  path_key filepath
</source>
```

In this configuration, event record is like below:

```
{"key":"value1","filepath":"/path/to/app.log"}
```

By default, `in_tail` emits events with `ASCII-8BIT` encoding. This is best for log forwarding. On the other hand, if you want to apply filters, it sometimes inconvenience when records contain non-ascii characters.
In this case, set `encoding UTF-8` resolves the problem. If you want to know supported encoding list, try following command:

```
$ ruby -e "puts Encoding.name_list.sort"
```

## Support multiline string in `"` quoted string

This is for configuration readability. Here is an example:

```
<source>
  @type foo
  config1 "foo
bar"
  config2 "foo\
bar"
</source>
```

In this configuration, `config1` is interpreted as `foo\nbar` and `config2` is interpreted as `foobar`. You can use `\` is to concatenate next line string without `\n`.

<br />
Lastly, v0.12.24 docker image has also been [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/tags).

<br />
Happy logging!
