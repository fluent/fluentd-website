# Fluentd v1.9.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.9.0. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release includes new config reload feature and some enhancements.

### New light-weight config reload

We introduce new configuration reload feature.
This re-creates only internal pipeline, so this is faster than existing worker-restart model.

You can use this config reload via `USR2` signal or `/api/config.gracefulReload` RPC.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

### Drop ruby 2.1/2.2/2.3 support

See [Drop schedule announcement in 2019](https://www.fluentd.org/blog/drop-schedule-announcement-in-2019).

### Support Ruby's Time class in msgpack serde

Fluentd uses MessagePack format for buffering data by default.
This has one limitation: Can't use msgpack ext type for non primitive class.

Since v1.9, Fluentd supports `Time` class by `enable_msgpack_time_support` parameter.

```
<system>
  enable_msgpack_time_support true
</system>
```

This is useful when your log contains multiple time fields.

### Major bug fixes

- output/buffer: Fix stage size computation
- buffer: Disable the optimization of Metadata instance comparison on Windows to avoid lots of buffer files
- server: Ignore Errno::EHOSTUNREACH in TLS accept to avoid fluentd restart

Enjoy logging!
