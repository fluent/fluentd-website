# New book on Fluentd

Manning has published a book on Fluentd called ***Logging in Action with Fluentd**, Kubernetes and more*.  The covers the underlying ideas of monitoring and logging through to the basic setup of Fluentd and Fluent Bit. It then progresses through the different types of plugins typically needed. Finally, it goes into deployment strategies, building your own plugins etc.

The book has some very good feedback from the community:

>  “I highly recommend using Logging in Action as a getting-started guide, a refresher, or as a way to optimize your logging journey.”
> —From the Foreword by Anurag Gupta, Fluent maintainer and Cofounder, Calyptia

> “A great exploration of the features and capabilities of Fluentd, along with very useful hands-on exercises.”
> —George Thomas, Manhattan Associates
