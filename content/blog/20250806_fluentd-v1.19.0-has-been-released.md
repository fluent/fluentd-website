# Fluentd v1.19.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.19.0 on 2025-07-30.
ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1190---20250730).

This release is a new release of v1.19 series.
This release includes many new features and bug fixes, with a particular focus on reducing operational and running costs and improving overall stability.

## Major new features and improvements
### Add feature to evacuate chunk files when retry limit
In this release, we added a buffer evacuation feature to the `buf_file` and `buf_file_single` plugins.
This simplifies recovery after failure.

When an output plugin fails to deliver data by network issue,
in previous versions, if the retry limit was exceeded and secondary output was not configured, the data would be discarded.

In this release, buffer files are automatically evacuated when the retry limit is exceeded. Once the issue is resolved,
you can restore the evacuated files to the original buffer directory and restart Fluentd to resume sending the data.

You can even restart without causing downtime to input plugins like `in_udp` by using the [zero-downtime restart](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/zero-downtime-restart) feature.

Evacuated files are stored at:

```
${root_dir}/buffer/${plugin_id}/
```

Ref. [Handling Successive Failures](https://docs.fluentd.org/buffer#handling-successive-failures)

**Note:** This feature is disabled when `secondary` outputs or `retry_forever` are used. To enable buffer evacuation, remove those settings.

### Improved buffer corruption detection
Buffer files may become corrupted due to events like system crashes or sudden power down.
In previous versions, Fluentd could fail to handle corrupted files properly, triggering errors on every restart.
You had to manually identify and delete the corrupted files.

This release improves buffer corruption detection.
When corruption is detected, the file is automatically moved to a backup directory, and startup errors are suppressed.

### Enhanced metrics
We have improved Fluentd's observability by enhancing its metrics capabilities:

* `Input` plugin metrics are now enabled by default.
  * Previously, you needed to explicitly set `enable_input_metrics` to `true`. From this release, it's collected by default. To disable, set `enable_input_metrics false`.
* New metrics for `in_tail`:
  * `tracked_file_count`: Number of files currently being tailed.
* New metrics for `output` plugin:
  * `write_secondary_count`: Cumulative count of records written to secondary output.
  * `drop_oldest_chunk_count`: Cumulative count of chunks dropped when `drop_oldest_chunk` is used for `overflow_action`.

### Performance improvement: switch from `yajl-ruby` to `json` gem
Previously, we used `yajl-ruby` for high-performance JSON processing, such as writing buffer chunks and parsing with `parser_json`.

However, in recent years, the standard Ruby json library has improved performance significantly. So we changed to use the `json` gem as the default JSON processor.

### Zstandard (zstd) compression support
We have added support for the Zstandard (zstd) compression format, which offers both high compression ratios and faster processing compared to gzip.

* The following plugins now accept compress zstd:
  * [buffer](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/buffer-section#buffering-parameters)
  * [out_file](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/file#compress)
  * [out_forward](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/forward#compress)

**Note:** To use zstd with `out_forward`, the destination server should support it. You cannot use it with Fluent Bit or Fluentd versions older than v1.19.0.

### TLS 1.3 support
The `out_http` plugin now supports TLS 1.3, offering enhanced security.
By default, TLS 1.2 is used. To enable TLS 1.3, set the [tls_version](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/http#tls_version) parameter as follows:

```
<match tag>
  @type http
  ...
  tls_version TLSv1_3
  ...
</match>
```

### Other useful improvements
* `in_forward` plugin:
  * [skip_invalid_event](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/forward#skip_invalid_event) is now enabled by default to skip corrupted records.
* `out_stdout` plugin:
  * Added the [use_logger](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/stdout#use_logger) parameter. Setting `use_logger false` forces output to STDOUT regardless of Fluentd's own logging configuration. This is especially useful in container environments like Kubernetes.
* `out_file` plugin:
  * Added `symlink_path_use_relative` to allow relative paths in `symlink_path`.
* System configuration:
  * Added [forced_stacktrace_level](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/system-config#forced_stacktrace_level) to control the log level of stack traces.

## Major bug fixes
### Fixed memory leak in `formatter_csv` plugin
To improve performance, it introduced a caching mechanism in `formatter_csv`, but incorrectly cached threads.
This caused memory leaks when used with in_exec, which spawns a new thread per log entry.

This fix is backported to Fluentd v1.16.8.

### `in_tail` plugin: fixed incorrect behavior with `encoding` option
The `in_tail` plugin provides [`encoding` and `from_encoding`](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#encoding-from_encoding) options.

* Expected usage:
  * Setting only `encoding`: Specifying encoding information.
  * Setting both `encoding` and `from_encoding`: Converting encoding.

Due to a bug since Fluentd v0.14.12 (at least from td-agent v3),
when only `encoding` was set, unintended encoding conversion occurred, it might corrupt log data.

In previous versions, you need to specify the same encoding for both encoding and from_encoding as workaround.

### Windows: fixed bug where service doesn't stop when the supervisor is dead
On Windows, if the supervisor process exited due to configuration errors, the service could continue running incorrectly.
This has been fixed so the service now stops as expected, improving error detection.

This fix is backported to Fluentd v1.16.8.

### Fixed `--umask` Bug
Fixed a bug where the `--umask` setting was ignored when used together with `--daemon`, leading to unexpected file permissions.

Enjoy logging!
