## in\_tail: `multiline_flush_interval` parameter 

In `multiline` mode, `format_firstline` is a trigger for flushing buffered event. This has one limitation that next event is needed. So if next event is delayed, flushing event is also delayed.

v0.12.20 introduces `multiline_flush_interval` to resolve this problem. If set `multiline_flush_interval 5s`, in\_tail flushes buffered event after 5 seconds from last emit. 

## filter\_record\_transformer: New `record["key"]` syntax

`record_transformer` filter uses `${key}` to access `key` field of event record. This is confusing syntax because `${time}` means event time, not `time` field of event record.

Since v0.12.20, `record_transformer` supports `${record["key"]}` syntax. This is same syntax with `record_modifier` and `elasticsearch_dynamic`. We recommend to use `${record["key"]}` instead of `${key}`.

```
<record>
  foo ${foo}           # existing syntax
  foo ${record["foo"]} # new syntax
</record>
```

<br />
Lastly, v0.12.20 docker image has also been [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/tags).

<br />
Happy logging!
