# Fluentd v0.12.16 has been released

Hi users!

We have released Fluentd version 0.12.16.
Here are the changes:

### New features / Enhancement

* parser: Add `null_value_pattern` and `null_empty_string` option for ltsv, csv and tsv [#657](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/657)
* RPC: Implement `/api/config.dump` and `/api/config.getDump` APIs to dump in memory config [#666](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/666)
* Add `--show-plugin-config` option [#663](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/663)

### Bug fixes

* in\_http: Fix `add_remote_addr` and `add_http_headers` options not working on bulk request [#673](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/673)
* parser: `RegexpParser#initialize` should wrap only Hash configuration [#647](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/647)

## Add `null_value_pattern` and `null_empty_string` for ltsv, csv and tsv parsers

In some real cases, TSV families have original null value pattern, e.g. `-`, `null`, `NULL`.
Fluentd parses `NULL` as a string but users want to treat these values as `nil`.
`null_value_pattern` is useful for such cases.

```aconf
<source>
  type tail
  path /var/log/httpd/access_log
  format ltsv
  null_value_pattern ^(-|null|NULL)$
  # other parameters
</source>
```

By this configuration, if your logs have `-`, `null` or `NULL`, parser converts it to `nil`.

In addition, if you want to treat empty string as `nil`, use `null_empty_string` instead.

## New RPC: `/api/config.dump` and `/api/config.getDump`

These RPCs dump in-memory configuration to fluentd's log or RPC response.
This is useful for checking running fluentd is old or not.

Here is a configuration example:

```aconf
<system>
  rpc_endpoint localhost:24220
</system>

<source>
  type forward
</source>

<match **>
  type stdout
</match>
```

Call `/api/config.dump` and get current configuration in fluentd logs.

```sh
% curl http://localhost:24220/api/config.dump
{"ok":true}

Your log has following lines

2015-09-30 19:37:51 +0900 [info]: dump in-memory config
2015-09-30 19:37:51 +0900 [info]: <ROOT>
  <system>
    rpc_endpoint localhost:24220
  </system>
  <source>
    type forward
  </source>
  <match **>
    type stdout
  </match>
</ROOT>
```

If you set `enable_get_dump` in `<system>` section, you can use `/api/config.getDump` to get configuration from RPC response.
This is turn off by default for security concern.

## master branch is now for v0.14

master branch becomes a development branch for v0.14 and we created v0.12 branch for maintaining v0.12 series.
If you have v0.12 specific patch, send it to v0.12 branch instead of master.
We have a plan to merge following features soon:

- Windows support [#674](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/674)
- Nanosecond time support [#653](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/653)

If we have a time, following feature may merge.

- SocketManager for sharing port between workers.

After that, we will release alpha version of v0.14 :)

Happy logging!
