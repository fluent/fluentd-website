# Drop schedule announcement about EOL of Fluent Package (fluent-package) 5

Hi users and developers!

As already planned before, we announce the dropping schedule for Fluent Package 5 (LTS) development.

## About Fluent Package v5

Since fluent-package 5.0.0 was released in 2023, fluent-package 5 has been maintained for a long time.

As new major version of fluent-package 6 was released in August 2025,
we decided to stop maintaining fluent-package 5 in Dec 31, 2025.

LTS version of fluent-package v6 will be planned support until Dec, 2027.
It will meet for your enterprise services.

## Scheduled end of life - Dec 2025

As you know, already stepping down maintenance activity, new minor update for fluent-package 5 will not be shipped anymore.
fluent-package v5.0.9 should be the last release of this series, it was shipped in Dec 19, 2025.

Thus, we recommend using fluent-package v6 for new deployment :)
