# Fluentd v0.14.15 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v0.14.15. Here are the changes ([full ChangeLog is available here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/ChangeLog)):

We say again, fluentd v0.14 is still development version. We need your feedback seriously!
If you try to use v0.14, check your configuration and plugins carefully.

### `<worker N>` directive

We introduced built-in multi-process feature since v0.14.12(See [release announcement](http://www.fluentd.org/blog/fluentd-v0.14.12-has-been-released)). New `<worker N>` directive enhances multi-process feature.

The limitation of multi-process was non-multi-process ready plugin can't be used together.
For example, we can't use in_tail plugin with `workers` parameter. Following configuration raises an error at startup.

    <system>
      workers 4
    <system>
    <source>
      @type forward
    </source>
    <source>
      @type tail
    </source>

`<worker N>` directive resolves this problem. You can invoke any plugins in specific worker(`N` is worker index)
and plugins under `<worker N>` acts as if they work on single process environment.
We can mix multi-process ready and non-multi-process ready plugins in one instance.
Working example with above configuration is like below:

    <system>
      workers 4
    <system>
    # work on multi process environment. worker0 - worker3 invoke in_forward plugin
    <source>
      @type forward
    </source>
    # work on only worker 0. worker1 - worker3 don't invoke in_tail plugin
    <worker 0>
      <source>
        @type tail
      </source>
    </worker>
    # <worker 1>, <worker 2> or <worker 3> is also ok

### Plugin: Add `formatted_to_msgpack_binary?` method to Output plugin API

We use `formatted_to_msgpack_binary` method to tell "This plugin uses msgpack for event serialization" to output core
when you customize `format` method.
This name is not rubyish, so we add `formatted_to_msgpack_binary?` method for better name.
We recommend to use `formatted_to_msgpack_binary?` for new plugins.

Of course, `formatted_to_msgpack_binary` method is available for existing plugins.

### Windows: Add several options to configure Fluentd windows service information

By default, Fluentd uses following settings for Windows service registration:

* Service name: `fluentdwinsvc`
* Display name: `Fluentd Windows Service`
* Service description: `Fluentd is an event collector system.`

Since v0.14.15, you can configure these settings via command line options.

* Service name: `--winsvc-name NAME`
* Display name: `--winsvc-display-name DISPLAY_NAME`
* Service description: `--winsvc-desc DESC`

### Major bug fixes

* in_http: Fix X-Forwarded-For header handling. Accpet multiple headers
* windows: Quote the file path to the Ruby bin directory when starting fluentd as a windows service

Enjoy logging!
