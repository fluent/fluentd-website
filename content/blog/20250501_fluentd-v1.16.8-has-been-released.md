# Fluentd v1.16.8 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.16.8 on 2025-05-01.
ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/v1.16/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1168---20250501).

This release is a maintenance release of v1.16 series.

This release will be bundled for upcoming `fluent-package` LTS version v5.0.7!

## Bug Fixes

### Windows: Stop the service correctly when the supervisor is dead

In this release, we have fixed a bug that Windows service process will continue running
even if the supervisor process is dead due to config error or etc.

With (fluentd#4942)[https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4942] fixed, it becomes easier to notice config errors and other issues.

### `formatter_csv`: Fixed memory leak

The caching mechanism introduced for performance optimization was caching threads inappropriately in `formatter_csv`.
The `in_exec` plugin creates a thread each time to emit an event.
Then all threads were cached in `formatter_csv`, causing a memory leak.

With [fluentd#4920](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4920) fixed, it becomes stable.

## Misc news

### Windows: Add fiddle as dependency gem for Ruby 3.5

For comming Ruby 3.5, we have added a `fiddle` gem as dependency.

### CI stabilization

We are enforcing stabilizing CI of Fluentd.
It has nothing to do with Fluentd's functionality directly, but it is very important to provide stable version of Fluentd continuously.

Enjoy logging!
