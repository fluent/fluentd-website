# Fluentd v1.4.2 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.4.2. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release includes several enhancements and bug fixes.

### in\_monitor\_agent: Expose current timekey list as a buffer metrics

`in_monitor_agent` now returns new `buffer_timekeys` field like below:

    {
      "buffer_queue_length":1,
      "buffer_timekeys" = >[1554741360],
      ...
    }

You can use this field to check current chunk status, e.g. delay, stuck or more.

### in\_tcp/in\_udp: Add `source_address_key` parameter

This is same as syslog input plugin.

    <source>
      @type tcp
      source_address_key addr
      # other parameters...
    </source>

With this configuration, client's address is assigned to `addr` field.

### Major bug fixes

* in\_tail: Create parent directories for symlink
* log: Fix time format handling of plugin logger when log format is JSON

Enjoy logging!
