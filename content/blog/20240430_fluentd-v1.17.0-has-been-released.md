# Fluentd v1.17.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.17.0 on 2024-04-30. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1170---20240430).

This release is a new release of v1.17 series.
In this release, we added some new features for some plugins and fixed bugs of Parser.

## Enhancement

### `in_tail`: Add `glob_policy` option for expanding glob capability of `path` and `exclude_path`

In this release, we added a new option [glob_policy](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#glob_policy) for [in_tail](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail) plugin.

In previous versions, we can use only `*` in glob patterns for [path](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#path) and [exclude_path](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#exclude_path) option.

Example:

```
path /path/to/*
exclude_path ["/path/to/*.gz", "/path/to/*.zip"]
```

From this version, we can also use `[]`, `?`, and `{}` in glob patterns depending on the `glob_policy` option.

Example:

```
path "[0-1][2-3].log"
glob_policy extended
```

Please see [the document](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#glob_policy) and [#4401](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4401) for more information.

### `out_http`: Support AWS Signature Version 4 authentication

In this release, we added a new option `aws_sigv4` for the [method](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/http#method) setting of [out_http](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/http) plugin.

By using this option, `out_http` can use [AWS Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html).

For example, this allows `out_http` to write to [Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ingestion.html).

Please see [the document](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/http#method) and [#4459](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4459) for more information.

### `out_http`: Add option to reuse connections

In this release, we add a new option [reuse_connections](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/http#reuse_connections) for [out_http](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/http) plugin.

This option will improve throughput of `out_http`.

Please see [the document](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/http#reuse_connections) and [#4330](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4330) for more information.

### `in_http`: Recognize CSP reports as JSON data

In this release, we make the data of the request where the `Content-Type` is `application/csp-report` be considered JSON by default.

Now, `in_http` can receive [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)'s report by default.

Please see [#4282](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4282) for more information.
