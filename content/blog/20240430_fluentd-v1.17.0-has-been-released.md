# Fluentd v1.17.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.17.0 on 2024-04-30. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1170---20240430).

This release is a new release of v1.17 series.
In this release, we added some new features for some plugins and fixed bugs of Parser.

## Enhancement

### `in_tail`: Add `glob_policy` option for expanding glob capability of `path` and `exclude_path`

In this release, we added a new option [glob_policy](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#glob_policy) for [in_tail](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail) plugin.

In previous versions, we can use only `*` in glob patterns for [path](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#path) and [exclude_path](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#exclude_path) option.

Example:

```
path /path/to/*
exclude_path ["/path/to/*.gz", "/path/to/*.zip"]
```

From this version, we can also use `[]`, `?`, and `{}` in glob patterns depending on the `glob_policy` option.

Example:

```
path "[0-1][2-3].log"
glob_policy extended
```

Please see [the document](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#glob_policy) and [#4401](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4401) for more information.

### `out_http`: Support AWS Signature Version 4 authentication

### `out_http`: Add option to reuse connections

### `in_http`: Recognize CSP reports as JSON data

## Bug Fixes

### Make sure parser returns hash

Enjoy logging!
