# Fluentd v1.3.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.3.0. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Output: Change thread execution control

This is internal change of output plugin.
This change should fix unexpected error like zlib's `DataError`.

### Output: Change default value of `queued_chunks_limit_size`

`queued_chunks_limit_size` is now same as `flush_thread_count` when `queued_chunks_limit_size` is not specified.

Before, `queued_chunks_limit_size` is unlimited. This causes critical situation with smaller `flush_interval`
when the destination has a problem.
For example, lots of very small queued buffer are created and it causes resource limit error.

Unlimited queued buffer is unexpected behaviour, so we changed this behaviour for safety.

### in_syslog: octet counting support

We introduced `frame_type` parameter.
With `frame_type octet_count` configuration, `in_syslog` accepts octet counting messages like below.

    44 <6>Sep 10 00:00:00 localhost logger: hello!

### Major bug fixes

* server: Fix deadlock between `on_writable` and `close` in sockets.
  This fixes fluentd restart issue with `in_forward`'s TLS setting error.

### Other improvements

* `in_http`: Add support for CORS preflight requests. Now you can send
  cross-domain AJAX requests with JSON payload to Fluentd.

Enjoy logging!
