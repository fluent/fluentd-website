## formatter: Add add_newline parameter to remove '\n' from the result

`json`, `ltsv`, `csv` and `hash` formatters now support `add_newline` parameter. If you set `add_newline false`, the formatted result doesn't contain `\n`.
This is useful for Queue / KVS plugins.

## in_tail: Capture unmatched lines

v0.12.32 introduces `emit_unmatched_lines` parameter to `in_tail` plugin. This option enables you to get unparseable line as an event.

For example, if you have following configuration and file:

- fluent.conf

```
<source>
  @type tail
  path /path/to/json.log
  format json
  emit_unmatched_lines true
  # ...
</source>
```

- json.log

```
{"message":"Hello!"}
This is broken line!
{"message":"Yay :)"}
```

Then, the following events are generated from this `tail` plugin.

```
{"message":"Hello!"}
{"unmatched_line":"This is broken line!"}
{" message":"Yay :)"}
```

Unmatched line is assigned to `unmatched_line` field.

This option works with both single-line and multi-lines.

## in\_monitor\_agent: Add `retry` field

Fluentd v0.14 adds `retry` field to `/api/plugins.json` response. The `retry` field contains detailed information of buffer's retry. For API consistency, v0.12's `in_monitor_agent` also provides same field. Here is `retry` field example:

```
{
  // other monitor_agent keys
  "retry": {
    "steps":1, // same as retry_count
    "next_time":"2016-12-23 01:37:16 +0700"
  }
}
```

Unlike v0.14, `start` field doesn't exist because v0.12's buffer doesn't have its information.

We recommend to use `retry`'s `steps` instead of `retry_count` for monitoring.

<br />
Lastly, v0.12.32 docker image has also been [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/tags).

<br />
Happy logging!
