## Bug Fixes

### Windows: Fix bug where the service accidentally stops after starting

In the previous version v1.16.8, the Windows service (fluentdwinsvc) accidentally stops after starting without stopping the supervisor and worker processes.
This is a critical bug of v1.16.8 for users who use Fluentd as a Windows service.

In this release, we have fixed this bug.

See [#4954](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4954) for more information.

Enjoy logging!
