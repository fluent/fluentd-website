## Bug Fixes

### Windows: Fix bug where the service accidentally stops after starting

In the previous version v1.16.8, the Windows service accidentally stops after starting without stopping the supervisor and worker processes.
This is a critical bug of v1.16.8 for users who use Fluentd as a Windows service.

In this release, we have fixed this bug.
