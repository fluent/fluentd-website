## Bug Fixes

### Server plugin helper: Fix bug where it may not properly close connections on Fluentd's shutdown

This issue has existed since this helper was first introduced and has affected at least Fluentd v0.14 and td-agent v3 and later.

The official plugins mainly affected are:

* [in\_tcp](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tcp)
* [in\_syslog](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/syslog)
* [in\_forward](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/forward)

This bug causes the following two problems:

* Even with [flush\_at\_shutdown](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/buffer-section#flushing-parameters) enabled, Fluentd may stop with buffer files left behind.
* There is a risk of losing received data during Fluentd's shutdown sequence although the probability is very low.

Fluentd normally shuts down each plugin in a safe sequence, but this bug causes it to continue receiving data unexpectedly during a phase when new data should no longer be accepted.

Even if buffer files remain, they will be restored on the next start, so this is not an issue.
On the other hand, when using a memory buffer, the risk of log loss becomes much higher.

Please note that this bug is unlikely to be a major problem when using a file buffer.
In the first place, server-type input plugins generally cannot receive data while Fluentd is down, so unless the client has a resend mechanism, there is always a risk of log loss during Fluentd's restart.
With the [zero-downtime restart feature](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/zero-downtime-restart) introduced in Fluentd v1.18 (fluent-package v5.2 or v6), Fluentd can now be restarted without downtime.

Enjoy logging!
