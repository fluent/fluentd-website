# fluent-package v5.0.3 has been released

Hi users!

We have released fluent-package [v5.0.3](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/releases/tag/v5.0.3).
fluent-package is a stable distribution package of Fluentd. (successor of td-agent v4)

This is a maintenance release of v5.0.x LTS series.
As significant slow starting service and crash issues during startup on Windows were fixed, we recommend upgrading to fluent-package v5.0.3!

### Changes from fluent-package v5.0.2

* Update fluentd to [1.16.5](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/releases/tag/v1.16.5).
  See [Fluentd v1.16.5 has been released](/blog/fluentd-v1.16.5-has-been-released) blog article about details.
* Update bundled plugins
  * e.g. fluent-diagtool v1.0.5. It supports to collect list of plugins on Windows.
* msi: fixed wrong environment path for Fluent Package Prompt ([#606](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/pull/606))
  * It breaks fluent-diagtool behavior to launch fluent-gem correctly.
* msi: removed unnecessary path delimiter ([#607](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/pull/607))
  * It doesn't cause any problem yet, but it should treat `%~dp0` correctly.
* rpm: fixed to take over enabled state of systemd service from td-agent v4 ([#613](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/pull/613))
* deb rpm: fixed to quote target files correctly not to cause migration failures ([#615](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/pull/615))
* msi: added a patch for RubyInstaller to avoid crash on start up ([#620](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/pull/620))
* msi: fixed slow start issue on Windows ([#631](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/pull/631))

### About next LTS schedule

We plan to ship next LTS version of fluent-package v5.0.4 on June, 2024.
The content of updates are still in T.B.D.

### About td-agent v4.5.2 and v4.5.3 (Windows)

As it was already announced [Drop schedule announcement about EOL of Treasure Agent (td-agent) 4](https://www.fluentd.org/blog/schedule-for-td-agent-4-eol), td-agent v4 was reached EOL in Dec, 2023.

There is a exceptional maintenance release for v4.5.3 on Windows because there was a crash bug during startup on Windows. It was backported fix from fluent-package v5 as
it is critical in some case.

We strongly recommend migrating from td-agent v4 to fluent-package v5 (LTS).
See [Upgrade to fluent-package v5](http://localhost:9395/blog/upgrade-td-agent-v4-to-v5)
