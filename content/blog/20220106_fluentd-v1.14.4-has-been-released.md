# Fluentd v1.14.4 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.14.4. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1144).

This release is a maintenance release of v1.14 series.

## Enhancement

### in_tail: Add max_line_size option to skip long lines

Starting from v1.14.4, `in_tail` supports a new option `max_line_size` that
allows to skip lines above a certain size.

```
<source>
  @type tail
  path /var/log/nginx/*.log
  ...
  max_line_size 8MB  # skip very long lines
  ...
</source>
```

This option can be used to ensure that messages coming from `in_tail` is
within `chunk_limit_size`, and will eliminate costly error handling on very
large messages.

## Bug Fixes

### Improvement on BufferChunkOverflowError handling

Beginning with this release, Fluentd will no longer raise
`BufferChunkOverflowError` on an oversized event stream if each event in the
stream is smaller than `chunk_limit_size`

**Example**

```ruby
es = Fluent::ArrayEventStream.new([[timestamp, {"message" => "a" * 1_000_000}],
                                 [timestamp, {"message" => "b" * 1_000_000}],
                                 [timestamp, {"message" => "c" * 1_000_000}]])

# Previously this could result in BufferChunkOverflowError even
# when chunk_limit_size is large enough (e.g. 1.2MB).
router.emit_stream(@tag, es)
```

See [#3560](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/3560) for more information.

### out_file: Fix inccorect append writeson macOS

Prior to this release, `out_file` failed to write to files if `append` option was
enabled on macOS with Ruby 2.7/3.0.

This issue was due to a bug in Ruby's IO implementation. This release contains a
workaround for that bug.

See [#3579]( https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3579) for details.

Enjoy logging!
