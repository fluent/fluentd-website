# Scheduled support lifecycle announcement about Fluent Package

Hi users!

We have released `fluent-package` [v5.0.0](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/releases/tag/v5.0.0) (Release Candidate) and 
the following [v5.0.1](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/releases/tag/v5.0.1) (General Availability).
fluent-package is formerly known as `td-agent` and a stable distribution package of Fluentd.

In this blog article, we explains why the concept of channels is introduced.

### Why is LTS (Long Term Support) channel introduced?

In the previous versions, `td-agent` was shipped as quarterly releases in most cases.
It sometimes contains fluentd minor upgrade occasionally, which means that not only bug or security fixes,
but also contains new features. As a result, there was a case that the stability was affected unexpectedly.

In point view of adopting fluentd (and `td-agent`) for enterprise services, there was a requirement for the distribution which contains security or bug fixes only
and scheduled lifecycle of it.

The LTS release is the answer to support them.

### Channels for updates

There are two channels of support lifecycle.

* Normal release
* LTS (Long Term Support)

Here is the difference of these channels.

* Normal release (5.x series)
  * Recommended for early adopters (eager to try new features of Fluentd)
  * Rapid release development (planned semi-annually releases, but it may vary.)
  * Fluentd will be upgraded occasionally
      * Minor upgrade will be applied. e.g. 1.16 => 1.17 and so on.
      * e.g. v5.0.1 (Fluentd v1.16.2), v5.0.2 (Fluentd v1.16.3), ... v5.1.0 (Fluentd v1.17.0)
  * The only latest version will be supported (bug fix will not be backported into older version)
* LTS (Long Term Support, 5.0.x series)
  * Recommended for enterprise services
  * Security and bug fix release only
  * Fluentd will be upgraded only in the teeny version and will stick to 1.16.x series.
      * Thus, the version number will be 5.0.x. (5.1 series will not be shipped)
      * e.g. v5.0.1 (Fluentd v1.16.2), v5.0.2 (Fluentd v1.16.3), v5.0.3 (Fluentd v1.16.4) ... v5.0.x (Fluentd v1.16.x)
  * Next major version will be `fluent-package` v6.0.0, and will be shipped in 2025.

As for fluent-package v5,

* fluent-package v5 LTS will be supported until Dec, 2025 (Even though Ruby 3.2 is still supported)
* Until 5.1.0 is released, normal release channel and LTS channel are the same package.
