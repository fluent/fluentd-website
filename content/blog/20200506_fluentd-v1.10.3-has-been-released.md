# Fluentd v1.10.3 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.10.3. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release fixes several bugs.

### record accessor helper: Support `set` method

This feature is for record mutation in the plugin. Here is code example:

```
record = {'key1' => {'key2' => "value"}}

accessor = record_accessor_create("$['key1']['key2']")
accessor.set(r, "new value!") # record is {'key1' => {'key2' => "new value!"}} 
```

### config: Ruby DSL format is now deprecated

We decided to deprecate experimental Ruby DSL configuration by following reasons:

- Hard to maintain full configuation features
- Hard to implement/parse in other system

### Major bug fixes

- out_forward: Disable `linger_timeout` setting on Windows
- service discovery: Fix warning of service discovery manager when fluentd stops

Enjoy logging!
