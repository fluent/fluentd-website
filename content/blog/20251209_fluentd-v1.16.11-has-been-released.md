# Fluentd v1.16.11 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.16.11 on 2025-12-09.
ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/v1.16/CHANGELOG.md#release-v11611---20251212).

This release is expected to be the final release of  v1.16 series.

This release will be bundled for upcoming `fluent-package` LTS version v5.0.9!

## Bug Fixes

### out_forward: fix issue where could cause output to stop when using <security> and TLS setting together under unstable network environments

This issue occurs when using `out_forward` with TLS enabled in unstable network environments.

If the communication is lost during the connection process immediately after TLS is established,
the `out_forward` connection process could fall into an infinite loop.
As a result, the log output stops completely.

To address this, we have updated the plugin to apply the existing [hard_timeout](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/forward#hard_timeout) parameter to this connection phase.
This introduces a mechanism to interrupt the stuck process via timeout and allow it to recover.

Enjoy logging!
