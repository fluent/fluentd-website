# Fluentd v1.14.2 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.14.2. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1142).

This release is a maintenance release of v1.14 series.

**IMPORTANT**: This release contain the fix for [CVE-2021-41186](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41186) -
ReDoS vulnerability in `parser_apache2`.
This vulnerabbility is affected from Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1.
We recommend to upgrade Fluentd to v1.14.2 or use patched version of `parser_apache2` plugin.

### Fixed ReDoS vulnerability in parser_apache2

`parser_apache2` plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability.

A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack.

There are two workarounds:

* Don't use `parser_apache2` for parsing logs which cannot guarantee generated by Apache.
* Put patched version of `parser_apache2.rb` into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).

As noted above, it requires a maliciously compromised Apache log to cause ReDoS.
Usually, such a log will not be generated by Apache, so the risk of ReDoS is low.

Patched version of `parser_apache2` is available from [parser_apache2.rb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluentd/v1.14.2/lib/fluent/plugin/parser_apache2.rb)

### fluent-cat: Added `--event-time` option for testing

In this release, `--event-time` option was added to `fluent-cat`.

You can send event in specific event time with `--event-time` option instead of sending time
in the previous versions.

```

echo '{"test": "ok"}' | fluent-cat --event-time "2021-10-29 13:14:15.0+00:00" tag
```

### GitHub: Your Configuration field was automatically quoted

Recently, when creating issue on GitHub, `Your Configuration` field was automatically 
quoted.

Most users doesn't quote `Your Configuration` field manually when they report a bug.
So it was changed to be quoted automatically.

### Upgrade attention for TD Agent users

If you use Fluentd v1.12 or later, we recommend to use at least v1.12.4.
It is because `in_tail` contains serious bugs in it.

As latest td-agent 4.2.0 bundles Fluentd 1.13.3.
If you want to upgrade Fluentd further more, upgrade it by yourself.

```
$ sudo td-agent-gem install fluentd --version=1.14.2
```

Enjoy logging!
