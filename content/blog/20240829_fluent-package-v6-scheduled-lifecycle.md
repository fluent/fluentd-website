# Scheduled support lifecycle announcement about Fluent Package v6

Hi users!

We had launched `fluent-package` v5 series last year, recently shipped [v5.0.4](/blog/fluent-package-v5.0.4-has-been-released) in LTS release channel and
[v5.1.0](/blog/fluent-package-v5.1.0-has-been-released) in normal release channel.

In this blog article, we explains the planned next major updates - v6.0.0.

### When the next LTS (Long Term Support) version available?

In short, we will ship fluent-package v6 in Aug, 2025.

We keeps two release channels as follows:

* Normal release
* LTS (Long Term Support)

Here is the difference of these channels.

* Normal release (6.x series)
  * Recommended for early adopters (eager to try new features of Fluentd)
  * Rapid release development (planned semi-annually releases, but it may vary.)
  * Fluentd will be upgraded occasionally
      * Minor upgrade will be applied. e.g. 1.18 => 1.19 and so on.
      * e.g. v6.0.1 (Fluentd v1.18.1), v6.0.2 (Fluentd v1.18.2), ... v6.1.0 (Fluentd v1.19.0)
  * The only latest version will be supported (bug fix will not be backported into older version)
* LTS (Long Term Support, 6.0.x series)
  * Recommended for enterprise services
  * Security and bug fix release only
  * Fluentd will be upgraded only in the teeny version and will stick to 1.18.x series. (T.B.D.)
      * Thus, the version number will be 6.0.x. (6.1 series will not be shipped for LTS channel)
      * e.g. v6.0.1 (Fluentd v1.18.1), v6.0.2 (Fluentd v1.18.2), v6.0.3 (Fluentd v1.18.3) ... v6.0.x (Fluentd v1.18.x) and so on.
  * Next major version will be `fluent-package` v7.0.0, and will be shipped in 2027 (T.B.D.).

As for fluent-package v6,

* fluent-package v5 LTS will be supported until Dec, 2025.
  * We expect users upgrade from v5 to v6 during the grace period.
* Until 6.1.0 is released, normal release channel and LTS channel are the same package.
* Upgrade from v4 or older version is not supported. Upgrade to v5 first, then upgrade it to v6.
