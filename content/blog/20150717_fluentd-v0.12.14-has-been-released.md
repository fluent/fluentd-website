# Fluentd v0.12.14 has been released

Hi users!

We have released Fluentd version 0.12.14, here are the changes:

### New features / Enhancement

* Configuration: Log unused section configuration as a warning level [#629](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/629).
* Configuration: Add '@' prefix to the log\_level this allow to keep the log\_level for backward compatibility [#630](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/630).
* Parser: Added a new time\_key option for the RegexpParser [#588](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/588).

### Bug fixes

* out\_forward: Add 'dns\_round\_robin' option [#632](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/632).

## out\_forward: DNS Round Robin support

out\_forward now supports DNS round robin. If you want to enable DNS round robin,
set `dns_round_robin true` in out\_forward configuration.

In addition, DNS round robin doesn't work with UDP heartbeat.
So if you use DNS round robin, please use `heartbeat tcp` or `heartbeat none` instead.

<br />

Happy logging!
